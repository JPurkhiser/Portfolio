# Orbit Propagations
This project is used to plot orbit propagations of a satellite around a given planet.

All three python files are required for this code to run properly, the "planetary_data" file has the Earth and the Sun as options
to run as well as a template to add other planets in.

The "OrbitPropagator" file then uses the data to run the equations and plotsand "op_test" is the file to run to get the plot.
