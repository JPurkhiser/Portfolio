#Orbit Propagations
This project is used to plot orbit propagations of a satellite around a given planet. /n
All three python files are required for this code to run properly, the "planetary_data" file has the Earth and the Sun as options /n
to run as well as a template to add other planets in. The "OrbitPropagator" file then uses the data to run the equations and plots /n
and "op_test" is the file to run to get the plot.
